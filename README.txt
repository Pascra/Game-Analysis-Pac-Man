Short description of the game:
"Pac-Man," released in 1980 by Namco, is an iconic arcade game where players control a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man through a maze filled with dots and four colorful ghosts. The objective is to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts. Pac-Man can also consume larger, flashing dots called "power pellets," which allow him to temporarily turn the tables and chase the ghosts. With simple yet addictive gameplay and distinctive characters, Pac-Man became one of the most influential and beloved video games of all time, spawning numerous sequels, adaptations, and cultural references. Programmed with C++ and using Raylib Library language.
